# SecureX-Encryptor
Message Encryptor is a Python-based project combining RSA, AES, and HMAC to ensure secure and tamper-proof communication. It encrypts messages with AES, secures the AES key using RSA, and verifies integrity with HMAC. Ideal for learning cryptography or safeguarding sensitive data

SecureX Encryptor
SecureX Encryptor is a Python-based project designed to ensure secure and reliable communication. By integrating RSA, AES, and HMAC, it provides a robust system for encrypting, decrypting, and verifying messages, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and secure key exchange.

Features
AES Encryption: Secures the message content using a symmetric encryption algorithm.
RSA Encryption: Protects the AES key by encrypting it with a public key for secure sharing.
HMAC Verification: Validates the integrity of the encrypted message, detecting any tampering.
User-Friendly CLI: Offers an interactive command-line interface for generating keys, encrypting, and decrypting messages.
Technologies Used :- Python
cryptography library for encryption and decryption
hmac and hashlib for integrity checks
How It Works
Key Generation

Generate RSA public and private key pairs for secure key sharing.
Message Encryption

Encrypt the message using AES with a randomly generated symmetric key.
Encrypt the AES key using the recipient's RSA public key.
Generate an HMAC to ensure message integrity.
Message Decryption

Decrypt the AES key using the private RSA key.
Verify the HMAC to detect tampering.
Decrypt the message using the AES key.
Project Structure
securex_encryptor.py: Main script for encryption and decryption workflows.
private_key.pem & public_key.pem: RSA key files generated by the script.
